files and their usage 
---------------------


----------------------
precalculatedDecoder.py
----------------------

-----INPUT PARAMETERS 

d - Lattice dimension (odd numbers 1,3,5... correspond to planar lattices)
error_type - Can be either "y" or "xyz" to define the error type 
lies - boolean True (for faulty measurements) or False (for perfect measurements)

-----OUTPUT

calculates parameters for the decoder and writes the results to (eg.) the following files: 

(for all cases)
'3syndromes_xyz_lies.txt': contains information on occurences of different syndromes   

(only for lying cases)
'3lies_xyz_lies.txt': contains information of probabilities of different lie patterns occurring

(for all cases)
'3results_xyz_lies.txt': contains information on  performance of the decoder for a range of physical error rates 



----------------------
compute_lies.py
---------------------

Analyses the output from *lies* and *syndromes*, to reproduce plot with different parameters. 


--------------------------------------------
part_compute_lies.py and run_compute_lies.py
--------------------------------------------

For lattice dimension of 5 (and higher) to computation in compute_lies.py is slow. These files
allow the process to be launched as a number of separate jobs.
